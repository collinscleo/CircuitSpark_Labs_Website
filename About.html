                <p id="laurenceParagraph"> and I am an ambitious, problem-solving person! ever scince I was young I have enjoyed
                    messing around with electronics but more often then not, because of my lack of knowledge in the subject,
                    I would break the devices and end up with one less device. This has inspires me to make kits and
                    instructions to help others to understand how these electronics work and not break them nearly as much as i did.
